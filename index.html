<h1>A little bit about myself...</h1>
<p>I am a kid that really wants to be an incremental game developer. I am not entirely old and I'm learning some programming languages. JavaScript intrigues me the most since it's usually used for games in HTML.</p>
<br>
<p>Most incremental games inspire me to do this kind of coding. Although I know that incremental games are not that popular, I still want to be in the incremental game community. I hope some of the incremental game youtubers play my incrementals (i.e. SuperSpruce <small>(and yes, I only have 1 youtuber in mind.)</small></p>
<br>
<p>Thank you to most incremental game developers (Aarex, soul147 and probably others).</p>
